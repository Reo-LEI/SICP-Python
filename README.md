# SICP-Python

## The goal of this project is to use python to emulate the LISP scheme solutions to the SICP exercises as much as possible, and to better experience the ideas expressed by SICP in a more familiar language.

This project mainly refers to the following websites:

[SICP Problem Set] (https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)

[sicp-solutions] (http://community.schemewiki.org/?sicp-solutions)

You can see the answers in LISP scheme with detailed explanations there.

If you have any ideas, please feel free to communicate with me.

Continuously updating...
